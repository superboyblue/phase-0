* Q: How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
	A: You can use devtools to inspect individual elements and the styling and add whatever styling element you want and have it show up instantly without changing anything. 

* Q: How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
	A: You can resize elements on the DOM by clicking on the element you want and then live editting the CSS to resize it to whatever your heart's content. 

* Q: What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
	A: Static positioning is the default and it means it is unaffected by attributes like right, left, top, or bottom.
	Fixed positioning means that the element is anchored to the viewpoint, meaning if you scroll up or down or left and right, it'll remain in the screen exactly where it started.
	Relative positioning makes it so that the element is relative to any positioning like left, right, top, or bottom and is moved away accordingly. It is not relative to other elements.
	Absolute positioning means that the element will always be positioned to its next nearest element. If nothing like that exists, it stays positioned to the document.

* Q: What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?
	A: The margin is the space between the edge of the document and the element, the border is the thing that wraps around the content, and padding is the space between the border and content. 

* Q: What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
	A: This challenge was pretty fun as it was very visual and felt more like a game of sorts than an actual assignment. My pair and I had a good time trying to figure what to do with the boxes and whether to make circles or squares. Having the ability to live edit and see immediately the results of our code was definitely cool, and devtool is super handy.
