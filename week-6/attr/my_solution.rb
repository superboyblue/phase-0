release 1
Q: What are these methods doing?

A: These methods are initially printing out information for a profile and then changing the data or attributes in the instance variables.

Q: How are they modifying or returning the value of instance variables?

A: The methods are modifying the values of instance variables by setting values to them. They have the getter method to take the names, and the setter methods to set it. 
So the first part takes the name and initializes it with a value and then the modifying part gives it another value, or sets one to it.
