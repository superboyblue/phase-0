Q: What is a wireframe?

A: A wireframe is a mockup of a website before any coding actually gets done. It's the initial vision, or prototype. It can be as simple as a black and white sketch on a piece of paper or a digital representation made in any number of programs available. It's the floorplan or blueprint from which you'll eventually start building your site from.


Q: What are the benefits of wireframing?

A: The benefits of wireframing are the flexibility it allows before any coding gets done. You can decide the layout, the subsequent interactions and any design aspect before anything is put in. It's the blueprints of the site and gives the opportunity to fix anything that needs fixing in the layout before a single line has been coded.
"Does your kitchen open up into your bedroom? Does that door lead anywhere besides a 4 foot drop into the backyard? Is that a stairway to heaven or the basement? Do we even have a basement?" These are probably the questions that could be answered by a good wire frame. 


Q: Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

A: I thoroughly enjoyed wireframing my site. I don't know how possible it is to implement any of the things that I want at my current skill level but I'm excited to see.


Q: Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

A: I made a few revisions but for the most part stuck with the original idea.


Q: What questions did you ask during this challenge? 

A: The questions I asked during this challenge were: 
"How am I supposed to figure out what a blog looks like? All these examples are of site with actual stuff on them?!"
"Does my wireframe look suspiciously like a geocities page?"
"Will my readers resent the fact that I have ad space in the sidebar?"
"Does this make me look as dumb as I feel?"


Q: What resources did you find to help you answer them?

A: In addition to the samples of wireframes, I went to a few sites that I frequent for inspiration. I also googled what a blog is. I know, I know. It's 2015! How do you not know what a blog looks like? To that I answer, "Isn't that why we're all here?" Probably not. But it's something I'd like to know before my time is over. I searched for geocities pages, too. And yes, yes it does. I asked a few people I know whether they'd be okay with ad space on my blog and they answered with "Is it a pop up?" and I said "no" and they said, "I tend to zone them out anyway." For that last one, I think it'll take some more introspection.


Q: Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

A: The only part of this challenge I found tedious was having to redraw lines because they weren't straight. I eventually gave up.
