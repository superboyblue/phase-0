<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was very easy and straight forward. We had a very smooth transition.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
It was easy. We didn't do much research as our working knowledge was adequate for this particular challenge.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
We did not use any style tags, nor did we use any font family or sizing.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
The good parts of HTML is that it's very structured and easy to read. The tags themselves seem pretty intuitive so far.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
Always open and close tags first before adding content.
