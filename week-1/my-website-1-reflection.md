Q:Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

Q:Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
A:To create a repository on github, first you have to have a github account. Then you go to the new repository form, name the repository something nifty, make it public so people can see it in all its glory, and give it a MIT license. Once you've done that, hit the button on the bottom that says create repository, and you're set!

Q:Describe what open source means.
A:Open source essentially allows people to use things freely and contribute without having to worry about getting permissions. 
Q:What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
A:I feel like open source is important for the betterment of people as a whole. While I do believe in intellectual property and the people who create things deserve proper credit and compensation for their work, open source projects are important for people who don't have the means to access certain programs and materials so that they may have the opportunity to make their contributions to the world.

Q:Assess the importance of using licenses.
A:Licenses allow for some amount of accountability when using open source. It gives credit to open source creators and contributors and doesn't allow others to lay claim to their work.

Q:What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
I'm definitely getting the hang of using git and github. I haven't had any aha moments yet, but i'm hoping they come soon. I struggled with and continue to struggle with some vm window editor that I can't seem to get a handle on.

Q:Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
