1.1 think about time
There were a couple of time management techniques that piqued my interest. The time boxing seems like a valuable tool in fighting that urge to soldier through a problem or task, to great detriment to both the final result and the person doing it. The other, which seems like both a time management and a productivity technique, is the tiny habits being anchored onto daily tasks that have already become ritual. Meditation seems like an awesome technique that I'm going to have to try. The idea that novelty affects the neuroplasticity is also something I'm going to try to incorporate. 

Time boxing in and of itself seems counter intuitive to me because I'm very goal oriented and will try and complete a task even if it's taking an inordinate amount of time and sometimes, ultimately untenable. The idea behind setting aside time, doing as much as possible in that time, stopping all work at the set time, evaluating what was done and processing it, is a very novel concept to me. I'm excited to give it a shot. I've never worked on anything within predetermined time frames; it'll be a good gauge on productivity and when things start to nose dive.

I currently manage my time rather poorly. I'll estimate how long it takes me to do something and I'm always overly ambitious or optimistic about either my ability or the amount of time anything takes. It's not that I'm ever late (not that often), and in a professional setting, I'm always able to deliver on times promised, but it lacks a certain amount of rigidity. I would have never considered time boxing a thing (with the exception of that brilliant moment in the movie "about a boy" where Hugh Grant's character talks about units of time and how certain activities take a given amount of units and he always knows. It was such an odd way of living that I assumed it was all a work of fiction.

My current strategy works for me, as I've never lost a client to tardiness, I'm rarely late for appointments, and I'm usually early or on time with my delivery times. I would however like to be able to keep myself from falling down rabbit holes chasing elusive goals or what have you. I am going to seriously consider time boxing. 

I have a series of recurring timers that each have their own label. Each time a given time unit is over, I'll attach a tiny habit to the end corresponding with its label. I'm excited to be able to do push ups and whatever else tiny things that will cumulatively create good lasting habits. 

My overall plan for phase 0 time management, and it's very tentative, is to spend as many of my free hours learning as much as I can about the topics given. I'm still going to do other things, but after speaking with a few members from other cohorts ahead of me, it seems like the more time i devote to immersing myself in phase 0, the better I'll fare. In the hours where I'm delving into the readings, i'll continue to try to time box, have breaks for meditation, learn through anchoring new ideas to novel stimuli and develop good, lasting, tiny habits. I hope it works! I'm going to be very mindful of my progress as I chase the flow. 

So essentially, before work, when I first wake up, I'll take a look at whatever I need to do. I'll give myself 25 minutes (pomodoro) to take a crack at it, and then get ready for work. Before I leave for work, I'll spend another 5 minutes looking over what I've completed with a fresh set of eyes. Once I return from work (my work environment isn't conducive to anything learning related), I'll continue with a 25 minute unit of time. I'll spend some time once that's up to let my mind quiet, before I dive into 45 minute units of time (the minimum time for a pairing session) to train myself to be in flow for that length of time. I'll continue to reflect on what i'm getting done, when it's being done, how i'm feeling during those times, to hone in on the 'zone.'

1.2 the command line
Bash is a shell program that allows us to interface with UNIX via the command line. It stands for born again shell. There are alternative shell programs available as well, so you don't have to feel stuck to one. But we're going to be stuck with this one. At least for now. Once we're comfortable and graduated, I'm sure we could switch. 
The most challenging thing for me were the two commands pushd and popd. It took several readings and multiple drills for me to figure out exactly they functioned and why they were superior in terms of directory navigation versus the other commands available. Once I pushed into enough directories and popped out enough times, I immediately saw the benefit of saved key strokes versus the change directory command (cd) or (cd-).
In my opinion, the most important commands would be sudo, help, man, find, and  grep.
even though I didn't use sudo because of all the danger emphasized with root permissions, it's important to be able to make permanent changes to the system if need be. Without superuser permissions, you'll never have full access. Help, is also very important when you really don't know why a command didn't work. Man is important to give you all the commands, find to find files, and grep to find things in files. They're all important, I'm sure. But these stand out to me.

Pwd prints working directory (that's the one you're in)
ls lists so you can lost files or folders or commands 
mv moves files or folders
cd changes directories
../ goes up a directory 
touch makes empty files or updates them
mkdir makes directories
less pages through files 
rmdir removes a directory
rm removes files or folders
Help lists brief explanations of each command

1.4 forking and cloning
So you want to make a repo. You're in luck! I just so happened to pick that up recently! So first you're going to have to sign into your github. Or maybe sign up for one if you don't already have one. Next, you're going to want to find the little button that says create a new repository (hint: it's usually by the tiny picture of your face!) From there, you're going to want to name it (something that you'll remember), make it public (so it's not hidden away from the world), and give it an MIT license so no one gets sued for using it! Now hit the create repository button!

Now you're going to want to fork something. Forking is something done to collaborate on software without affecting the original. So imagine a multiverse where the future spans out from this moment into infinite possible worlds. Your fork is your world and you get to control what happens there. Everyone else's fork is their own, and they'll create their own little version of the main branch. 

So onto the mechanics of it. Go to the page where you're wanting to fork something. Hit the fork button on the top right of the screen, and now you have a copy in your github page!

You'll probably want to do something with it at some point, maybe on your computer, i'm thinking in the command line, so you'll have to clone it over! 

So find the clone url on the bottom right of the screen and copy it over.

In your terminal, use the pwd command to make sure you're in a safe space (a directory that isn't the same thing). Then you type git clone whatevertheurlyoucopied, and then hit return and some stuff happens and you've got it!

 

 

The struggles i had setting up git and github weren't very many. It was pretty smooth sailing with the exception of some vague instructions about windows. I'm pretty sure if i could do it all over again, i would do it in a mac os or linux something.
